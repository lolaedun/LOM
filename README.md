 # **Little Ones Manual**

![Mock up](wireframes/mock-up.png)


## **Goal for this project**

Have you ever been nervous about handing your child over to someone to look after especially when your child has
medical needs and suffers from severe allergies and skin conditions?

Are you getting lots of phone calls and messages about whether it's ok for your child to take part 
in certain activities or eat certain foods?

What if your child has an allergic reaction and you're not around to care for them... Where and How do you 
relay all this important information?

The Little Ones Manual is an example of how to put all this information together so everyone is on the 
same page about looking after your little one. 
Instead writing down all the information about what to do on paper, text messages and phone calls
you can use the Little Ones Manual to keep it all in once place. 

Next time you get a phone call or text message, you can easily refer them to your little ones manual and 
finally be able to answer all those repetitive questions you keep getting asked!

## Wireframes

These wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) during the Scope Plane 
part of the design and planning process for this project. I have decided to go for a 1 page website
to make it easier to access information quickly.

You can find my wireframes below:

# Features
 
## Existing Features

### Elements on every page


#### Navigation
For the navbar I have used Boostrap to create a responsive navbar. 
There is a hamburger icon for mobile devices to make it more user-friendly. 
I have implemented the scroll spy option from bootstrap to help the user navigate easily to each section of the page. 
For this to work properly I have fixed the navbar on the top of the page.
The navigation bar features a logo on the far left, which links to the home page of the site.

#### Home Section

I have decided to add 3 main section cards with buttons which spreads over 100% width of the screen. 
The 3 buttons link to the corresponding sections on the webpage
The cards respond well when viewing on desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### Skincare Section

Here I used the grid from bootstrap to create 5 different lists to make it easier to read the 
information quickly and easily.

#### Safe Foods Section

Here I also worked with the grid from bootstrap to create a different set of lists which interact
with the user when hovering over the food items. I have removed the effect on hover that gives
the user the impression that it's clickable in order to avoid confusion. I have also styled
the food groups into different colours to make it easier to quickly identify them.

#### Sample Meal Plan Section

I have purposely left this background colour the same as the safe foods section to demonstrate
they both fall under the diet part of the webpage. This makes the information more easy to understand.
Initially there was a hover effect on the meal plan but this has been taken out as it became
an unneccessary distraction for the user. The striped rows on their own make the meal plan
more legible and quick to grasp the information.

#### Sample Routine Section

Here I have used flexbox from bootstrap to create the 3 sections so they are mobile responsive.
