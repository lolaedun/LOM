# UX

## Goals

### Visitor Goals

The central target audience for Little ones manual are:
- Anyone who is looking after my little one e.g family members or hired help or school

User goals are:
- Find out if it's ok to give the little one a certain food item.
- Find ideas on meals to make him.
- Follow his routine to keep consistency with his care.
- Understand how to look after his skin and manage flare ups.
- Have a reference for anytime there is uncertainty about his care.

The Little Ones Manual is a great way to meet these needs because:
- All the information that the carer needs is available and easy to find.
- The website can be searched using text search, making it easy for 
carers to acces specific information.

### Creators Goals

The Goals of the creator are:
- Provide enough information to whoever is looking after the little one to feel confident 
in his care.
- Create consistency in his routine and care.
- Feel a sense of reassurance that the little one is being looked after in a way
that feels reassuring to both the little one and his primary carer.

## User Stories

As a visitor to The Little Ones Manual website I expect/want/need:

1. To easily find what I am looking for, I want the layout of the site to 
be easy to navigate to the information I need.

1. To search for what I am unsure about in the search bar using keywords.

## Wireframes

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
